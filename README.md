#  SwiftyPhotoMoments


This project was built to demonstrate a way to recreate the first tab in Photos.app for iOS, where the photo library assets are organized by Moment and the most recent photos are at the bottom of the collection view. It was built with Swift 4.2 on Xcode 10 and is not intended for reuse, or meant to be complete.

Things missing from this project:
-  Photo library change handling (it doesn't perform any animated insertions or react to changes in any way)
- The ability to zoom in and out of Moment clusters (months, years, etc.). This project more closely mirrors the Xcode Simulator version of Photos.
- The ability to select, delete, open, or edit photos or videos.

Most of the image caching code was taken and adapted from Apple's sample code for the Photos framework.
